 Credit Risk Analysis

# Objective
Predict whether a loan applicant is “high-risk” or “low-risk” using applicant details (income, credit history, loan amount).

# Tools & Tech
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Dataset: [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)

# Approach
1. Data Cleaning: Missing values handled, categorical encoding applied.
2. Model: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
3. Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall.

# Results
- Best model: Random Forest with ~80% accuracy.
- Credit history & applicant income were the most important predictors.

# Business Impact
Automates loan approval, helping banks like Barclays minimize default risk & improve decision-making.
